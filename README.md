# 📈 Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates a machine learning-based approach to predict stock prices using historical data. It leverages Python and libraries such as pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and scikit-learn to process data, visualize trends, and build predictive models.

## 📌 Description

The **Stock Price Prediction** project is aimed at forecasting future stock prices using historical data. By analyzing previous stock market trends, the model attempts to predict the closing price of a stock using machine learning techniques. The primary goal of this project is to provide insights into how data preprocessing, feature engineering, and modeling can be used in a real-world financial scenario.
